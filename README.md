## DAFNet: Introduction
The repository is a code implementation of DAFNet.
Since the dataset is private, we only provide the code.
We provide an implementation based on Faster R-CNN, 
and other detection methods can be implemented with minor changes.

The configurations of all fusion methods can be found in 
./DAFNet_configs

where:
./DAFNet_configs/DAFNet_faster_rcnn_AFF.py is our DAFNet 

## DAFNet: Installation

You can prepare the environment by following steps: 

conda create -n DAFNet python=3.9 -y

conda activate DAFNet

pip install torch==1.10.1+cu102

pip install torchvision==0.11.2

pip install -r requirements/build.txt

pip install mmcv-full

pip install tifffile

python setup.py develop

## DAFNet: Usage
Please follow the guidance of MMDetection

## MMDetection

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh-CN.md)

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3+**.

<details open>
<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.
</details>


Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.

## License

This project is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Changelog

**2.18.1** was released in 15/11/2021:
- Release [QueryInst](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01928) pre-trained weights.
- Support plot confusion matrix.
- Fix SpatialReductionAttention in PVT and fix trunc_normal_init in both PVT and Swin-Transformer.

Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/changelog.md) for details and release history.

For compatibility changes between different versions of MMDetection, please refer to [compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md).

## Installation

Please refer to [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for installation.

## Getting Started

Please see [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for the basic usage of MMDetection.
We provide [colab tutorial](demo/MMDet_Tutorial.ipynb), and full guidance for quick run [with existing dataset](docs/1_exist_data_model.md) and [with new dataset](docs/2_new_data_model.md) for beginners.
There are also tutorials for [finetuning models](docs/tutorials/finetune.md), [adding new dataset](docs/tutorials/customize_dataset.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), [customizing models](docs/tutorials/customize_models.md), [customizing runtime settings](docs/tutorials/customize_runtime.md) and [useful tools](docs/useful_tools.md).

Please refer to [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for frequently asked questions.

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions to improve MMDetection. Ongoing projects can be found in out [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/projects). Welcome community users to participate in these projects. Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contributing guideline.

## Acknowledgement

MMDetection is an open source project that is contributed by researchers and engineers from various colleges and companies. We appreciate all the contributors who implement their methods or add new features, as well as users who give valuable feedbacks.
We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research community by providing a flexible toolkit to reimplement existing methods and develop their own new detectors.
